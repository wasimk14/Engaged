  We met, we introduced each other, and on this day, 4 years back, we decided to entangle ourselves in a relationship.
  A relationship that is supposed to be beautiful.  
  A relationship that is supposed to last long.  
  A relationship that is supposed to last forever.  
  A relationship that is supposed to be filled with love.  
  A relationship that is supposed to be filled with respect.  
  A relationship that is supposed to be filled with trust.  
  A relationship that is supposed to make us happy.  
  A relationship that is supposed to keep us together, in good or bad situations.

  I am happy, I chose you.  
  I am happy we chose each other.
